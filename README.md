# Cranking the Coding Interview Study Notes

## Big O

### Time Complexity

Big O time is the language metric we use to describe the efficiency of algorithms.

No matter how big the constant is and how slow the linear increase is, linear will at some point surpass constant.

#### Big O, Big Theta, and Big Omega

Academics use big O, Big Theta, and big Omega to describe runtimes.

- Big O: describes an upper bound on time. Ex: An algorithm that prints all the values in an array could be described as
O(N), but also as O(Nˆ2), O(Nˆ3), or O(2ˆn) (or many other big O times) since **the algorithm is as fast as as each of
these**.

- Big Omega: is the equivalent concept but for the lower bound. Ex: Printing values in an arrays is Omega(N), as well as
Omega(log N) and Omega(1) since **the algorithm won't be faster than those runtimes**.

- Big Theta: means both O and Omega. **An algorithm is Theta(N) if it is both O(N) and Omega(N)**.

*Industry's meaning of big O is closer to what academics mean by Theta, in that it would be seen as incorrect to
describe printing an array as O(Nˆ2). Industry would just say this is O(N).*

Quick Sort Algorithm:

    Best Case: O(N)
    Worst Case: O(Nˆ2)
    Expected Case: O(N log N)

### Space Complexity

Time is not the only thing that matters in an algorithm. We might also case about the amount of memory -- or space --
required by an algorithm.

### Multi-Part Algorithms: Add vs. Multiply

- If your algorithm is the form "do this, the when you're all done, do that" then you add the runtimes.

- If your algorithm is in the form "do this for each time you do that" then you multiply the runtimes.

### Amortized Time

When the array hits capacity, the ArrayList class will create a new array with double the capacity and copy all the
elements over to the new array.

If the array contains N elements, inserting a new one will taken O(N).

I the array is not full, the insertion will take O(1) time.

It allows us to describe that this worst case happens every once in a while, but once it happens, it won't happen again
for so long that the cost is amortized.

When inserting we double the capacity when the size of th array is power of 2. So after X elements, we double the
capacity at array sizes 1, 2, 4, ... X, which means 1, 2, 4, ... X copies.

Since 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + X is roughly 2X, X insertions take O(2X) time. The amortized time for each insertion is O(1).

### Log N Runtimes

When you see a problem where the number of elements in the problem space gets halved each time, that will likely be a
O (log N) runtime.

### Recursive Runtimes

When you have a recursive function that makes multiple calls, the runtime will often (but not always) look like
O(branchesˆdepth), where branches is teh number of times each recursive call branches.

```
int f(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    return f(n - 1) + f(n - 1);
}
```

Runtime of the code above is O(2ˆN).

> Therefore, the sum of (2 ^ 0) + (2 ^ 1) (2 ^ 2) + ... + (2 ^ N) is (2 ^ (N + 1)) - 1 

The base of a log does not matter for big O since logs of different bases are only different by a constant factor.
However, this does not apply to exponents. The base of an exponent does matter.

### Examples:

1. What is the runtime of the code below?

```
void foo(int[] array) {
    int sum = 0;
    int product = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        sum += array[1];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        product *= array[1];
    }
    System.out.println(sum + ", " + product);
}
```

O(N)

1. What is the runtime of the code below?

```
void printPairs(int[] array) {
    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < array.length; j++) {
            System.out.println(array[i] + ", " + array[j]);
        }
    }
}    
```

O(Nˆ2)

1. What is the runtime of the code below?

```
void printUnorderedPairs(int[] array) {
    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < array.length; j++) {
            System.out.println(array[i] + ", " + array[j]);
        }
    }
}
```

The number of steps total is: (N - 1) + (N - 2) + (N - 3) + ... + 2 + 1 = (N / 2) * (N + 1). Thus the runtime will be
O(N ˆ 2).
